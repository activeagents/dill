Analyze this content and suggest which sources from the library might be relevant.

## Content to Analyze
<%= @content %>

## Available Sources
<% @source_summaries.each do |source| %>
- ID: <%= source[:id] %> | <%= source[:name] %> (<%= source[:type].upcase %>)
  <%= source[:summary] if source[:summary].present? %>
<% end %>

## Instructions
Review the content and identify which sources would be most relevant as citations.
For each suggested source, explain:
1. Why it's relevant to the content
2. What specific claims or statements it could support
3. Confidence level (high, medium, low)

Format your response as a JSON array:
```json
[
  {
    "source_id": 1,
    "relevance": "High confidence - directly supports the security claims",
    "suggested_context": "Page 12, section on authentication"
  }
]
```
