## Instructions

Use your browser tools to research this topic. Here's a recommended workflow:

**Option 1: Direct URL search (most reliable)**
1. navigate(url: "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=<%= ERB::Util.url_encode(@topic) %>") - Go directly to search results
2. extract_links() - Get the search result URLs
3. navigate(url: "...") - Visit promising results
4. extract_main_content() - Read the page content
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for multiple sources

**Option 2: If direct search doesn't work, go to authoritative sites directly**
- For Ruby gems: navigate to "https://rubygems.org/gems/GEM_NAME" or "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO"
- For general topics: navigate to "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPIC"
- For documentation: navigate to official docs sites
