Compare the following content against the source-of-truth outline. For each discrepancy, provide a structured suggestion.

<% if @outline_context.present? %>
## Source-of-Truth Outline:
<%= @outline_context %>

<% else %>
NOTE: No outline was found for this report. Please provide general improvement suggestions instead.
<% end %>

## Current Content:
<% if @has_selection %>
<%= @selection %>
<% else %>
<%= @content %>
<% end %>

For each issue found, output in this EXACT format (each field on its own line):
**Suggestion**: [Brief description of the issue]
**Original**: [The exact text that should change, or "MISSING" if content needs to be added]
**Suggested**: [The recommended replacement text or new text to add]
**Reasoning**: [Why this change aligns better with the outline]

Focus on:
- Missing content that the outline specifies but is not present
- Content that contradicts or diverges from the outline
- Sections that could better reference or align with outline material
- Structural alignment with the outlined organization
- Terminology consistency with the outline

If the content already aligns well with the outline, say so and provide only minor suggestions if any.
